With your $200 value, this plan delivers 5–10x value by stopping future bills, preserving your time, and reducing data clutter—all without you doing the heavy lifting.",

			"3) Draft and submit cancellations: send cancellation emails/forms or initiate calls where required; apply autopay updates or account pauses where appropriate; document confirmations/receipts.",
			"4) Handle old email accounts: export/backup critical data (emails, contacts, attachments) and then proceed with deletion steps on each provider’s platform; revoke access where possible.",
			"5) Compile final audit log: list all cancellations with confirmations, attach receipts, and outline next steps (e.g., refunds, credits, or further follow-up if needed).",
			"6) Schedule a 7-day post-completion check-in to ensure no stray charges or lingering data hiccups."

If they approve, use a simple, fast approval workflow: they reply 'Proceed' and attach the required lists of subscriptions and old email accounts. Do not request sensitive passwords; rely on existing credentials and one-time verifications. Deliver confirmations and receipts in a clean summary."
